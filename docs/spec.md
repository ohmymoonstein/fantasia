### Text VRAM IO

Text mode VRAM information is accessible at 0x04000 as an array of 32640 entries of 16-bit integers (1020 bytes). Each entry in the array represents a character in the 30x17 text mode screen. The last 32-bits in this region is unused. The following table shows the layout for elements of this array.

Description       | Size

ASCII code        | 8bit
Background color  | 4bit
Text color        | 4bit

240x136 4bpp

### Mouse IO

Mouse input information is accessible at 0x2D000 as a 32-bit value.

The X and Y position values represent where the mouse cursor is pointing in screen. Valid values for X range from 0 to 239 and for Y range from 0 to 135. The X and Y values will be 255 if the cursor is outside the screen.

The H and V scroll values are used for the horizontal and vertical mouse wheel deltas. These represent the amount of steps they had moved in the last frame. These are two's complement numbers, with their sign indicating which direction they're scrolling.

Description  | Size
-------------|-------|
X position   | 8bit
Y position   | 8bit
Left         | 1bit
Middle       | 1bit
Right        | 1bit
H scroll     | 6bit
V scroll     | 6bit
(unused)     | 1bit

### Calling convention

Function arguments are pushed on the stack in the right-to-left order (i.e. top of the task contains the first argument). The callee is responsible for cleaning the stack before pushing the return values, behaviour automatically done by `return`.
